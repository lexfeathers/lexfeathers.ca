  After what feels like way too long, I finally have a new Void Femmes single to share!

Heya all, I've been busy![^1] My latest song _Faltering Stair_ has just released on [Bandcamp](https://voidfemmes.bandcamp.com/track/faltering-stair) and [Ampwall](https://ampwall.com/a/voidfemmes/album/faltering-stair). This is the first "pop" song I've released under the Void Femmes name, I think, and I'm excited to get it into people's hands! 

I had a lot of fun rethinking my approach to vocals in this one, and the guitar parts were a blast to record. If you've been reading this blog for a while, you might remember that this song actually got [a whole post](/posts/faltering-stair-(song-demo)) about the process when it was just a little baby demo :')

I also made a music video for this release! Last weekend, I came up with a very simple idea, shot it in my kitchen with stuff I had lying around, and had it all edited by Sunday evening. I'm thrilled with the turnaround and how fun the process was. It was my first Davinci Resolve edit, so there was a bit of admittedly frustrating adjustment, but I'm proud of the results and I'm glad to be using free editing software finally!

You can watch _Faltering Stair_ below:

One thing I would be remiss not to mention was the use of [Endre Simo's 'ascii-fluid' software](https://github.com/esimov/ascii-fluid) for the graphical background visuals in this video. It's a Go program he wrote which tracks pupils and displaces particles rendered as ASCII characters in a terminal. 

With some tinkering, I got this running on my laptop and danced around to the song while screen recording to capture some rhythmically relevant footage. Originally I had the particles set to a `○` symbol, but yr girl is gay as hell so we inevitably ended up with little pink hearts. `♥`

[^1]: Notably but also hopefully invisibly: I've ported this whole site from Nunjucks onto [Vento!](https://vento.js.org) Finally, I won't have to worry whether or not to use `asyncEach` or `for`. Coding this thing is so much simpler and I no longer have to type `{% %}` delimiters. My hands are so happy :')
