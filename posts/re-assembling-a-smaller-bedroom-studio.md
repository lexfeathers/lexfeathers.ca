excerpt: A quick update on setting up my new studio space.
---
Up until recently, I had a large studio space separate from my bedroom. It was awesome, and I made detailed use of every square inch of the room. I had a big window with a couch, all my guitars hanging on the walls, and a whole lot of space to walk around while recording.

My circumstances have changed and I'm back to figuring out a combination bedroom/studio/office space. Today, I've started hanging my diffusion panels and bass traps:

This is a really goofy way to hang a bass trap. It is, however, the cost of having really goofy corner angles in your room. Thankfully, this room is of newer-construction than my old one, meaning that it's not impossible to locate studs behind 100 year-old plaster and lath. We've got drywall here, baby!!! 

One must imagine Sysiphus happy.

Another notable thing I was able to do here is install an ethernet port on the wall near where my desktop sits. Gigabit ethernet. We love her.

Things are a bit slow getting set up so far, due to trying to give myself time to figure out what the flow of this room _should_ be. I am 1/2" shorter than the ceiling height, which presents pretty big ergonomic and acoustic challenges that I didn't have to worry about in the old place. There also isn't nearly enough wall space to put up all of my acoustic treatment panels, which is a shame. Thankfully, my bed _kind of_ acts like a bass trap, so I should hopefully be alright without all of the panels set up. 
Another thing about not having wall space is I've had to figure out a solution for storing my guitars while making them accessible. I ended up reverse engineering a certain multi-tier guitar stand I saw online, and 3D printing it. That design process was deeper than I feel like going into for this post, so I may tackle that in a future update if people are interested. For now, here are a couple photos of the stand:

It's hard to downsize when it comes to the space I spend all my time in, but it's necessary and I'm excited about some of the advantages this space offers over the old one. For now, it's an ongoing project to just get things functional, but I think it will come together and feel very cozy in the future.
