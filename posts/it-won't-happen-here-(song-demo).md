excerpt: >-
  This song can be characterized by it's very off-kilter time signature. To be
  truthful, I haven't sat down to figure out what the timing actually is, since
  it's all been by feel so far. Guitars are wonderful stim toys, aren't they?

Hello, I've been busy getting back into playing my telecaster! I had a lovely chat with my bandmate Olivia from [Waxlimbs](https://waxlimbs.com) the other day about trying different tunings as a songwriting prompt, and I ended up putting that inspiration into ...changing my ancient strings on this guitar. 

I didn't end up using a very different tuning at all, in fact I found myself in Drop D. Here's what I've written so far:

<aside>To be fair, I've been writing in Drop C for a long time now, so coming up to D was kind of interesting for my ears in a way I didn't expect.</aside>

This song can be characterized by it's very off-kilter time signature. To be truthful, I haven't sat down to figure out what the timing actually is, since it's all been by feel so far. Guitars are wonderful stim toys, aren't they?

It's been really nice to get back into this guitar. I don't play a lot of single-coil stuff these days, and getting re-aquainted with the things a telecaster can do has been refreshing. There's nothing quite like the neck pickup on these things, though I admittedly am not using it here.[^1]

For bass, I'm doing my typical Dingwall thing with a bit less dirt than usual to allow the guitars to do the heavy lifting. 

Not much else to say! Beyond music, I've been working on a website commission for another musician which has been a lovely experience, and I can't wait to be able to show that off! 

I still need to finish up my portfolio section for this site, though most of the work will just be bringing over the project data/copy. Grunt work, basically. 

Till next time!

[^1]: The setup is as such:
- Tele into a Revv G20
  - Middle position for the cleans
  - Bridge position for the dirt
