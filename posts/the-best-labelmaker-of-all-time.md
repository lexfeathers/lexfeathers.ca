  The Dymo 1570 (1960s/1970s). It looks like a prop from Star Trek DS9, crossed
  with the chromed-up props of The Original Series.

  The Dymo 1570 is built like a tank, with cast metal sides. It feels good to
  use ("ka-chunk"), and it's very repairable.

I recently went up to north-Toronto to pick up a label maker I found online after going through a bit of a Marketplace journey. A nice lady sold it to me for $10.

The reason I got this thing is because I love embossing label makers. I love how the labels look, I love how the text is raised and that they don't use ink which rubs off after years of wear and tear. They remind me of panel labelling on old electronics projects you'd find at a wholesale or second-hand place like A1 Electronics in Etobicoke (iykyk).

Why not just buy a _new_ Dymo embossing label maker, you ask? Well, dear reader, it's because they're manufactured like absolute dogshit now. They do not hold up to repeated use, they are extremely annoying to repair, and... they're just not stimmy like this old thing is. Plus, the design of it! It's amazing!

The 1570 is built like a tank, with cast metal sides. It feels good to use ("ka-chunk"), and it's very repairable. I get extremely bothered by stuff that's not meant to last. I don't like owning it.

Naturally I'm in a state of over-labelling, being excited about a new toy. I've put my name on my modular synth. I have labelled all my boxes of keycaps. I'm trying to hold back, but it's hard. It's too fun to use!

Anyway go find a Dymo 1570. They _do not_ make them like they used to.
