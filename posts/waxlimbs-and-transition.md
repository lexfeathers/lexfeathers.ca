  Being a singer during an ongoing pandemic is hard enough without Big Feelings being part of the mix.

I've been a musician for a long time now. I started making music in earnest at 16 when I bought a copy of Sony Acid Music Studio.[^1] It would be years before I had bandmates and could play instruments, but the day I opened up that rudimentary DAW for the first time is when I consider Waxlimbs to have started.

Waxlimbs is now a band with four people in it: Olivia Cox, Paul Geldart, Will Jarvis, and myself. One of our strengths is that Olivia, Will and myself all sing when we play live. We harmonize, and trade lead vocals depending on the song. We all have very different voices and skillsets as singers. It feels so special to be able to sing with my bandmates and feel like our voices come together to make a greater whole.

My relationship to my voice has always been a bit strained. When I was younger, I wanted to be able to sing more like my musical heroes but felt limited by timbre ("this is the voice you were born with" kind of stuff), and as I got older, gender dysphoria crept into the frame. I've been singing in Waxlimbs since I was a teenager, and have done _a lot_ of work to learn to appreciate the voice I have. Transness has at times upended the sense of security that I've grown from this work.
