1. brief overview of band, current band makeup and my role

I've been a musician for a long time now. I started making music in earnest at 16 when I bought a copy of Sony Acid Music Studio on December 26th, 2010.[^1] It would be years before I had bandmates and could play instruments, but the day I opened up this extremely shoddy DAW for the first time is when I consider [Waxlimbs](https://waxlimbs.com) to have started.

Waxlimbs is now a band with four people in it: Olivia Cox, Paul Geldart, Will Jarvis, and myself. One of our strengths is that Olivia, Will and myself all sing when we play live. We harmonize, and trade lead vocals depending on the song. We all have very different voices and skillsets as singers. It feels so special to be able to sing with my bandmates and feel like our voices come together to make a greater whole.

With all of that said, my relationship to my voice has always been a bit strained. When I was younger, I wanted to be able to sing more like my musical heroes, and as I got older, gender dysphoria crept into the frame. I've been singing in Waxlimbs since I was a teenager, and have done _a lot_ of work to learn to appreciate the voice I have. Transness has at times upended the sense of security in myself I've grown out of that work.

In 2020, we stopped playing shows as the (very much ongoing) COVID 19 pandemic began, and for a long time it didn't feel like we've ever get back on stage. When we finally did in 2022, I felt like I'd hit a massive snag as a vocalist; I have to wear a respirator while performing.

I cannot tell you in a blog post how much this sucks to do despite my need to not get covid, ever. Breath control is now hardmode, and the key problem this post aims to provide some ideas for is that it seems like front-of-house always has a really tough time getting my voice to cut throught the mix. It's often hard to hear me clearly. Add "she has a low and 'round'-sounding voice" to this, and you've got a dysphoria nightmare.

There are elements of singing lessons and voice training that can help with this. I speak with a brighter timbre than I used to, and I have a better sense of how to project my voice. I want to focus on tools though, since those efforts only get me so far. 

It has been helpful to narrow down which respirators seem to be the most acoustically transparent. In rehearsals, I wear duckbill-style masks (known as eclipses) which are comfortable and generally don't interfere too much with microphones picking up my singing. That said, they are ugly as sin and don't come in black, so they won't do on stage. 

I've been trying different tri-fold kn95s for a while now, and find Breatheteqs to be one of the more breathable models. They come in black so they're fashionable and they don't muffle _too_ much, though they're far from a perfect singing mask. I like tri-folds because they don't poke the mic when I bring it close to my face, and they fit nicely under our costume masks.

The second breakthrough has more recently been microphone choice. To illustrate the technical problem, I struggle to be heard through my mask, and as a result struggle to hear myself in the wedges so front of house has to thread the needle by having my mic hot and monitors boosted. This creates a lot of feedback potential. 

To work around this, I've been making use of microphones with hypercardioid[^2] polar patterns. [Hypercardiod mics](https://mynewmicrophone.com/what-is-a-hypercardioid-microphone-polar-pattern-mic-examples/) reject a lot more sound from the sides of the capsule, and are very sensitive directly in front,  making them very directional. This means that as long as the mic is pointed away from the monitors, we should be able to worry less about feedback.

When I first upgraded from the usual sm58, I got myself an SE V7 since it was only marginally more expensive than an sm58 (by about $30 CAD). In the time since getting this mic, I've still felt it's not quite bright enough to compensate for a respirator covering my mouth. 

There was a sale at my local music store recently and I managed to get the mic I _actually_ wanted to buy, a Shure Beta 87a. It's similar to the V7 in that it's a hypercardioid mic, but that's about where the similarities end. It's most notably a condenser mic, which means it needs 48v of phantom power to run. I've never used a condenser at gigs before, so I'm in new territory here. Importantly, the Beta 87a is significantly brighter than the V7.
