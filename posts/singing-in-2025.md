I've been a musician for a long time now. I started making music in earnest at 16 when I bought a copy of Sony Acid Music Studio on December 26th, 2010.[^1] It would be years before I had bandmates and could play instruments, but the day I opened up this extremely shoddy DAW for the first time is when I consider [Waxlimbs](https://waxlimbs.com) to have started.

Waxlimbs is now a band with four people in it: Olivia Cox, Paul Geldart, Will Jarvis, and myself. One of our strengths is that Olivia, Will and myself all sing when we play live. We harmonize, and trade lead vocals depending on the song. We all have very different voices and skillsets as singers. It feels so special to be able to sing with my bandmates and feel like our voices come together to make a greater whole.

My relationship to my voice has always been a bit strained. When I was younger, I wanted to be able to sing more like my musical heroes but felt limited by timbre ("this is the voice you were born with" kind of stuff), and as I got older, gender dysphoria crept into the frame. I've been singing in Waxlimbs since I was a teenager, and have done _a lot_ of work to learn to appreciate the voice I have. Transness has at times upended the sense of security that I've grown from this work.

In 2020, we stopped playing shows as the (very much ongoing) COVID 19 pandemic began, and for a long time it didn't feel like we'd ever get back on stage. When we finally did in 2022, I felt I'd hit a massive snag as a vocalist; I need to wear a respirator while performing.

I cannot convey in a blog post how much this sucks to do despite my need to not get covid, ever. Breath control is now hardmode, and the key problem this post aims to provide some ideas for is front-of-house's trouble with getting my voice to cut through the mix. It's hard to hear me clearly- there's a layer of fabric in front of my face after all! A low and raspy-sounding voice is the cherry on top of a dysphoria nightmare.

There are elements of singing lessons and voice training that can help a little. I speak with a brighter timbre than I used to, and I have a better sense of how to project. I want to focus on tools though, since training only goes so far. 

The first helpful thing has been to narrow down which respirators seem to be the most acoustically transparent. In rehearsals, I wear duckbill-style masks (Eclipses) which are very comfortable and generally don't interfere too much with microphones picking up my singing. That said, they are ugly as sin and don't come in black, so they won't do on stage. 

I've been trying different tri-fold KN95s for a while now, and find Breatheteqs to be one of the more breathable models. They come in black so they're fashionable and they don't muffle _too_ much, though they're far from a perfect singing mask. I like tri-folds because they don't hit the mic when I bring it close to my face, and they fit well under our costume masks.

The second breakthrough has more recently been microphone choice. To illustrate the technical problem: I struggle to be heard by the mic and as a result struggle to hear myself in the monitors, so front of house has to thread the needle by having my mic hot and wedges boosted. This creates a lot of feedback potential. 

To work around this, I've been making use of microphones with hypercardioid[^2] polar patterns. [Hypercardiod mics](https://mynewmicrophone.com/what-is-a-hypercardioid-microphone-polar-pattern-mic-examples/) aggressively reject sound coming from the sides of the capsule, and are very sensitive to sound sources directly in front. This makes them very directional, which means that as long as the mic is pointed away from the monitors we shouldn't have to worry as much about feedback.

When I first upgraded from the usual sm58, I got myself an SE V7 since it was only marginally more expensive than an sm58 (by about $30 CAD). In the time since getting this mic, I've still felt it's not quite bright enough to compensate for a respirator's interference. 

Recently, there was a sale at my local music store and I managed to get the mic I _actually_ wanted to buy, a Shure Beta 87a. It's similar to the V7 in that it's a hypercardioid mic, but that's about where the similarities end. It's a condenser mic which means it needs 48v of phantom power to run. I've never used a condenser at gigs before, so I'm in new territory here. Importantly, the Beta 87a is significantly brighter than the V7, which should ideally compensate for the muffling effect more.
