Hi all, I'm so so so happy to announce that my band [Waxlimbs](https://waxlimbs.com) has finally compiled all of our 2020-2021 singles into [an album.](https://waxlimbs.bandcamp.com/album/where-lilies-grew)

For context, we released a single every month for a year, starting in October 2020. 
We've been calling this our "12x12" series since then, which doesn't quite have a nice ring to it. Another issue that arose after we had wrapped up the run of releases, was that people kept asking for a record and our response was continually kind of "...this _is_ the record." 
Over time people kept seeing our 2019 album [The Autumn Bell](https://waxlimbs.bandcamp.com/album/the-autumn-bell) and thinking it was our most recent work, because that's how streaming services present your work on your artist page; Albums followed by EPs/singles.

So here we are! It's been really nice to go back through these songs and find the right tracklist order for them, and to explore those spaces I was so deeply in, back at the start of the pandemic. I've also remastered [Earth is Unmade](https://waxlimbs.bandcamp.com/track/eath-is-unmade) so that it fits the album around it better, so there's a bit of a goodie there for those who have been following along for the past few years.

For the immediate future, this record will be a bandcamp exclusive. 
In a few weeks, we'll add it to streaming services to make it a bit easier for people to hear if they're not into downloads, or if they don't use Bandcamp's streaming app.

Thanks for the support, and I hope you enjoy the music!
