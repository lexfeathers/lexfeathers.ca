  Playing a stage this big has always been a dream of mine, and to get to play
  Katie's songs with her was the cherry on top. I've been a fan of the music for
  a decade now so getting to be a part of this was surreal, to say the least.

I played my first gig with [Austra](https://Austra.fyi) this weekend, handling bass guitar and synths. We headlined
Ottawa Pride, which was a wild experience.

Playing a stage this big has always been a dream of mine, and to get to play Katie's songs with her was the cherry on
top. I've been a fan of the music for a decade now so getting to be a part of this was surreal, to say the least.

The weather in Ottawa this weekend couldn't have been nicer, so I took some time the day after the show to see the
sights and have coffee with an old friend. I'm feeling very spoiled right now ♥️
