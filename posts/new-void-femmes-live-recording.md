Hey gang, if you liked [my typewriter thing,](https://lexfeathers.ca/posts/voidfemmes-sixninehaus-2024/) then you can now grab a nicely recorded set using the setup.

[Listen or buy it on Bandcamp :)](https://voidfemmes.bandcamp.com/track/carving-out-a-little-hollow-2024-09-12)

This was improvised and recorded live on September 12th, 2024 in Toronto, at a hockey-themed dive bar of all places.

A little program note: 
this is an improvised live electronic music performance for typewriter and modular synth. For each of these performances, I sit down at my typewriter and come up with ${something} on the spot, and "play" the modular synth with it. The idea is that my writing feeds into a generative synth patch, and the patch responds with inspiration for the writing when I get stuck. I have a bow, my hands, and various odds and ends at my disposal for playing the typewriter. It's a conversation between machines which makes use of my typical behaviour of constantly jumping between tasks as a conduit for performance.
