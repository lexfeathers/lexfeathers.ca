excerpt: 'Comments!! They work! '

This is just a quick update that I've now got comments on this site that work without the user needing to log into github, for all you who are still sacred. 

I want to give a huge thank-you to [Damien](https://damien.zone/), who set me up on the Friends Of Eggbug commentario server and gave me a really good basis for a stylesheet that makes the widget look _close enough_ to my site's styling for my tastes.

I previously was using Giscus, which worked well enough on a technical level, but it had two major issues. You couldn't style it without getting very deep into the weeds, and users needed a github account to comment with it. While I do have some dev pals, this is ultimately a music blog and I don't think many people outside of the cohost crowd have github accounts, or like the idea of commenting with one.

Outside of this, I've been dipping my toes into some JS frameworks and have been pretty focused on filling in webdev knowledge gaps. At the same time, a lot of not-very-noticeable updates have been pushed to this site ;)
