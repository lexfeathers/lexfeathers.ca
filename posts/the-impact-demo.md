Ever find an old project and think "wow I have to finish that"?

Liv (<a href="https://waxlimbs.com" target="_blank">Waxlimbs</a> vocals/keys) and I took a trip into the woods in late 2020 and apparently made this (I don't really remember the process occurring). 

This trip was a really wonderful time. I remember driving around the big curve on the main road in the evening on our way up, and just sort of blurting out "So I think I might be trans." 
Her reply was a cheery "Oh, okay, this definitely feels like a conversation to be had over scotch but I guess we're already there!" She was the first person I told.

The weekend was spent in a cabin during a misty couple of days in early October, cooking, drinking very nice scotch, doing our makeup and staying warm by a fire constantly burning in the woodstove. 

I had brought my acoustic guitar with us so we'd have something to play and Liv immediately took to it. She hadn't tried guitar before, but something in her clicked and it was in her hands for pretty much the entire trip. We drove into town and found a cheap classical guitar for her at a pawn shop.

It was during this time that she came up with the song that would become Waxlimbs's <a href="https://waxlimbs.bandcamp.com/track/it-has-a-name" target="_blank">"It Has A Name"</a>, and this demo also bloomed out of it.
Musically, I really like how the guitars are kind of adding to the story texturally, and how her voice sounds like it was recorded far away in a small room. It's nerve-wracking...

I might bring this one up at the next band meeting as something we should develop.

Also, I found these cool pitcher plants (pictured above) in a swamp on that trip. I'm so taken by how alien they feel and figured they'd be a nice image to pair with this demo.
