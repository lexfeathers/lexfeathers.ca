If you don't know me, I'm trans and I experience a lot of vocal dysphoria with singing being no exception! 

I've been trying to approach it in a constructive way recently by forcing myself to try holding different voice "shapes" when singing to see if there's anything in my singing voice I like. If I find something, I can start to identify what muscles/etc are causing it to sound that way, and improve my technique. Then I need to sleep in order to process, I suppose.

This was the first thing I've done in a long time where I felt excited about the potential in my voice, like I unlocked something really important. Feels like progress, and since my cohost presence is more chill and personal than elsewhere, I figured I'd share.

**If you're trans and have done work on singing wrt dysphoria, I'd love to hear about it!**

Words:

```
I might not make it through
in the event of succession, I leave this to you
I might not see you there
in a garden of silence, carry on the work
```
<sub>this might turn into a waxlimbs song if the others like it</sub>
