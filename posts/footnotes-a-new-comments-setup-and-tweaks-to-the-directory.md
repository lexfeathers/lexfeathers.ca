It's been a while since I've posted anything. The very short cliff notes are: I'm so tired. I'm ok though. I just need a year off.

On a more localized note, social media has gotten rough for me again with the influx of bsky users from X. While it's nice to see some old faces who have finally moved over, it's gotten _loud_ on there![^1] I've found myself kind of receding in my online presence a bit as a result. Moving my mastodon account to a new instance has been nice, but you know how it is. Posting is only fun if you _build the whole goddamned thing you're posting on from scratch._

With that in mind, I took it upon myself to play around with this website tonight, to see if I could get a bit more excited about text on screens. It turns out this thing never gets old and always presents new rabbit holes to dig into.

Here's what's changed as of today:

- I now have [a contact form on the contact page!](https://lexfeathers.ca/pages/contact)[^2]
- Comments have been replaced with github discussions.[^3]
- I redesigned how individual entries look in [the directory](https://lexfeathers.ca/pages/directory)
- I added footnotes![^4]

Somewhere in all of these changes, I broke the deno.lock file this site uses to track versions for dependencies. I don't know how it happened. I don't know why it happened. Somehow I fixed it by changing the version number from '4' to '3' based on a screenshot I found in a discord server. No, I do not understand why this worked. :|

Working on this stuff has got me thinking about posting again and I figured just getting writing in any way at all would be better than brooding. So here we are, kind of a changelog. Tinkering is a good way to get myself engaged with websites, so I'll keep tinkering.

[^1]: In addition to this and the US going full fash, I also got followed by some anti-trans hate accounts. This is kind of a first for me, so it hasn't helped my sense of unease around social media.
[^2]: I'm using [Staticforms](https://www.staticforms.xyz/) for this. No more `mailto:` links!
[^3]: I feel bad making people log in with Github to leave comments, but for the time being this is kind of what I was able to pull off with my skill level, and specifically my lack of understanding how to host my own comments. ([Damien,](https://damien.zone) expect a DM from me at some point if this doesn't work out)
[^4]: Can you tell that I'm having fun with footnotes?
