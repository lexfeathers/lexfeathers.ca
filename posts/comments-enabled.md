excerpt: Comments are now a thing on this site! Try them out on this post~

Just a quick update that I've got comments working on this site now. I'm using Chirpy, and while I don't love how freeform it is, _it works._
Setup was simple, and for now this should work. Quite annoyed that I can't tweak the colour scheme to match my site, but it's better than commentbox (which forces a colour scheme that will not work if you don't have a black text on white background scheme.)

If you have any tips, tricks, or suggestions for other implementations, please let me know ...in the comments! :)
