Just a quick update that I've got comments working on this site now. I'm using Chirpy, and while I don't love how freeform it is, ~~_it works._~~[^1]
Setup was simple, and for now this should work. Quite annoyed that I can't tweak the colour scheme to match my site, but it's better than commentbox (which forces a colour scheme that will not work if you don't have a black text on white background scheme.)

If you have any tips, tricks, or suggestions for other implementations, please let me know ...in the comments! :)

[^1]: I don't get a tonne of comments, but I was dismayed when chirpy dumped the few I had (some very nice messages from friends!). I've moved to using Github Discussions via the [Giscus app.]([Link](https://giscus.app/)). This way, I can store my comments on the same repository as the site, and I have some moderation tools in what Github gives me.
