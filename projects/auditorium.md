An experimental generative audio game developed in Unity. I wanted to explore fully generative audio using a framework I knew well: [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/). 

Under the hood of this project is a collection of synthesizers I designed in Pure Data that create an electroacoustic pitch sequence based on player input from the game. Each collectable object holds a synthesizer voice, which gets added to the player's main "sequencer" and continues to generate audio in realtime in the form of a C# script.

The idea was that depending on the player's movements, a totally unique soundscape could be assembled in a playthrough. Extended plans for this project included gallery installations.

Progress is halted on this project, as the framework we used to compile the Pure Data patches to C# (Heavy by Enzien Audio) is now defunct.
