> Emergent Fates is a Japanese-inspired Role Playing Game about finding identity and purpose in a world where your fate has already been decided.

> Personable characters, rich world history and a fully realized storyline are combined with beautiful water-coloured 2d graphics for an artistic and narrative experience, while multi-class leveling, and turn-based battles allow for the customization and immersion which are staples of roleplaying.

Coming onto this project at the end of its development cycle was exciting because I got to look at the work empirically, seeing where things fit or could be modified. It was really fun working with another Sound Designer in this capacity!
