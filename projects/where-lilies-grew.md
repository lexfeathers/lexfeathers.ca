[Where Lilies Grew](https://waxlimbs.bandcamp.com/album/where-lilies-grew) was my band Waxlimbs's first full-length album since 2019's [The Autumn Bell.](https://waxlimbs.bandcamp.com/album/the-autumn-bell)

This album was originally incrementally released as singles, from October 2020 through to September 2021. For this project (originally titled _12x12_), we wrote, recorded, produced and released a song every month for one year. 

It gave us the unique opportunity to work with a variety of artists on cover art for each instalment, and helped us hone our songwriting skills and our vision for what the band should be. 

In 2024, we opted to collect the songs into album form, with special attention paid to a new track order. For the album release, I gently remastered the song 'Earth is Unmade' to better fit the context of the record.
