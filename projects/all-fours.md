> The music heavily features breakbeats, weird distorted synths, occasionally guitars, and spacey vocals. The intent is to sound aggressive, playful and sensual.

This was the first solo electronic album I had worked on since 2019's [Nine Demons.](../../projects/nine-demons) I had been spending [a lot of time and energy](https://waxlimbs.bandcamp.com/album/where-lilies-grew) on Waxlimbs in the intervening years, and needed a return to form. I wanted to try my hand at making aggressive electronica, and dove into breakbeats for the first time in ages. What came out of that process was "All Fours", which reignited a creative drive in myself I had been missing in my personal work.

This is an EP I tried to put together as fast as possible, so to ensure I would enjoy the process and still be happy with the music when I released it. It's very grimy and moody; I went for "ugly" sounds this time around, since I've noticed I have a tendency to fall into a "pretty" soundscape typically. 

Returning characters are that of my minibrute ("_To Break On A Cellular Level_", "_Why Did It Have To Be Jupiter?_"), my PO-12 drum machine ("_All Fours_"), with a new focus on the use of my Moog Sub37 on tracks like "_A Mouth Will Suffice_".

This thing was made quickly and aggressively and I like to think that comes through in a good way. [You can buy it on bandcamp.](https://voidfemmes.bandcamp.com/album/all-fours)
