> A puzzle game that explores the emotional rollercoaster of a long-distance relationship — in a world of folding paper! Flip, fold, unfold and rotate paper puzzles to help a couple navigate the complexities of living apart.

I had the absolute pleasure of working with [Lightning Rod Games](https://lightningrodgames.com/a-fold-apart/) to provide some additional Sound Design for a bonus chapter added to A Fold Apart at the start of 2021. In the new chapter, you play as a Teacher and their dog, Princess Maggie Pupperpants. It’s a ridiculously cute addition to an already great game!

I worked on the game via FMOD and Git, adding foley for background elements and scoring complex cutscene animations.
