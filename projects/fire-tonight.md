I’m very happy to have scored and designed the sound for [Fire Tonight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188900/Fire_Tonight/) by [Reptoid Games,](https://www.reptoidgames.com/), available now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188900/Fire_Tonight/) and [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/products/fire-tonight-switch/). 

The game was inspired by a 1990 [Information Society track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKPSk5bZ8rI) also called Fire Tonight, and the goal of the score was to embody the early '90s aesthetics and playfulness of Information Society's music. I had a lot of fun dipping my toes into a genre-space I'm not used to, and feel that the resulting score was a bright and punchy contribution to the game's world.

You can stream the OST on Bandcamp:

## About the game:

> Maya and Devin are separated in a city on fire. In the year 1990, before cell phones or Internet. They’re on their own, wondering about the choices that brought them here, how they met, and what the future might hold. Inspired by Information Society’s song of the same name, Fire Tonight is a lighthearted but thoughtful walk through the story of a relationship. A story about believing in each other when the whole world tries to keep them apart.
