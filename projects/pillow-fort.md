> "Pillow Fort is a side-scrolling action/defense game where you are trying to survive against your nightmares. You have your toys, your imaginary friends, and most of all, your pillow fort. Try to defeat the nightmares before they can melt their way through the fabric and feathers of your fort. Time is not on your side."

For Pillowfort, I acted as a Sound Designer and handled the game’s audio integration directly in Unity. Another project working closely with [Catbaux](https://catbaux.com/) (Music Composer for Pillowfort), we brought together all of the audio elements for the game into a cohesive whole.

The game is currently in open Beta, and can be played via [Itch.io.](https://phazed.itch.io/pillow-fort)
