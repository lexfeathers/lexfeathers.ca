In October of 2020, my band [Waxlimbs](https://waxlimbs.com) released our single _Dead In The Water_. Shortly afterward, we shot, edited and released an accompanying music video.

This project marked a return to video editing after my spending years away from it. We hired [Adrienne McLaren](https://adriennemclaren.com) to shoot for us, and designed the set ourselves. 

The experience of putting this video together would later be instrumental in preparing me for the editing work on [From The Garden,](../projects/from-the-garden) our full-length concert film.
