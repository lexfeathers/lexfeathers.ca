I was invited to [compose a piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrzwgHzECqA) for Spectrum Music's 100 Seconds To Midnight concert series in mid-2020. I was excited by the challenge of writing music for other musicians to perform; something I don’t often get to do. 

The piece was written from the conceptual jumping-off point of early nuclear armament development, and the criticality events that accompanied them. I took a couple of weeks to draft parts for each member of the ensemble, attended a virtual rehearsal, and tweaked the final copy of the music for the final performance, which was filmed and presented via Youtube.
