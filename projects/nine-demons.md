> Taking inspiration from field recordings and stray pieces of hardware, there is a dusty and organic tone to these songs, like collected memorabilia that loses luster through time spent in drawers and closets. Yet while relic may be at play, there is also something sharp about the music- it largely remains prickly and fuzzed out.
> The Demons in question are malevolent artifacts of past experience. Old rolls of film full of surprises, dust-caked piles of notes, old works. Nine Demons is a dream catcher for these things, a filter containing the basic recipes for little pains.

[Nine Demons](https://feyla.bandcamp.com/album/nine-demons) was my first full-length album under the name Feyla. This record is a return to solo form after years of work in a group configuration of [Waxlimbs](https://waxlimbs.com/).

My aim with this record was to rediscover what makes the act of making music itself fun, and to learn what kinds of production could get me excited about what I was learning at the time. This is an electronic record with a large variety of sound sources, such as my minibrute, a bass guitar, field recordings, and vocals.
