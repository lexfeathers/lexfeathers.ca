In 2024, I was approached by [Michael Silverwood](https://pixilestudios.com/) about composing the opening theme for a podcast he was starting with a few friends. The requirements were for a short, introspective and driving tune that would work well with dialogue over top, as happens at the start of each episode.

You can hear the song in the opening of any Certainly Uncertain podcast episode, or in the audio player below:
